## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted green (#90EE90) evokes a sense of growth and learning. The color is inspired by concepts of growth in a language as well as the history of green in iconography for indicating a passing or approval, such as grading in schools.
- Background color: A very light gray (#F5F5F5) provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop to focus attention on the content.
- Accent color: A soft teal (#70DBD1), analogous to green, provides gentle visual cues without overwhelming the interface, in order to promote an association to new vocabulary.
- Clean, sans-serif font for readability.
- Simple, intuitive icons for easy navigation.
- Clear, divided sections for video display, manual transcription, and automated transcription.
- Smooth transitions between video clips and subtle animations for user feedback.
